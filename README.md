# Slung-Gun
This is a simple 2d pixel style platformer game using pygame.

## Idea
Slung Gun is a simple game where a soldier is appointed to protect the island from the invaders. He is provided with a gun and he can shoot down the enemies to protect the island. <br>
Enemy are dropped on the island from a plane and after reaching the island they will start shooting at the player.

## Technology Used

1. **Windows Paint** for the making pixel style images.
2. **sfxr** is used for making sfx of the game.
3. **Bosca Ceiol**  for the game music.
4. **VS Code** is used as code editor.

## What I have learned.
1. I have the deep knowledge of python
2. I have understand how to make the game that appeals to users.
3. I have gained the basic knowledge of music creation.

## What changes I will do in this game in future
1. I will add more islands for player to spawn so that player will have more than one terrain.
2. I will add more types of guns and bullets, all have different effect on the enemy.
3. I will also make different types of enemies.
